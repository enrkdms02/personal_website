                My name is Gaeun Doo and I am from South Korea. I moved to Canada when I was in grade 2 and lived in Surrey, BC since then.
                I have three siblings and a golden retriever. My <em>favorite</em> thing to do in my free time is going out with my dog and 
                walk around the neighborhood. I graduated high school in 2020 but did not go to post-secondary immediately because I <strong>valued</strong> 
                the experience you can gain from jumping into a workplace environment.
