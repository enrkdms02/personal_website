                My name is Gaeun Doo and I am from South Korea. I moved to Canada when I was in grade 2 and lived in Surrey, BC since then.
                I have three siblings and a golden retriever. My <strong>favorite</strong> thing to do in my free time is going out with my dog and 
                walk around the neighborhood.
