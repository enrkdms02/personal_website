            A Paragraph About Me
        </h1>
        <p>  
            My name is Gaeun Doo and I am from South Korea. I moved to Canada when I was in grade 2 and lived in Surrey, BC since then.
            I have three siblings and a golden retriever. My <em>favorite</em> thing to do in my free time is going out with my dog and 
            walk around the neighborhood. I graduated high school in 2020 but did not go to post-secondary immediately because I <strong>valued</strong> 
            the experience you can gain from jumping into a workplace environment. I worked as a waitress at a Korean restaurant for a year, 
            which helped me gain lots of experience and relationships. After experiencing the life of a waitress, I decided to study 
            psychology at Douglas College. I enjoyed studying psychology but there were not many options for me to choose from after 
            finishing the study and realized that it was not the right path meant for me to carry on. For this reason, I was looking 
            for a new area of study and chose CIT at BCIT because of all the diverse opportunities and paths it provides.
